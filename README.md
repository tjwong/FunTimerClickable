## FunTimerClickable

### Description

A fun short program that plays with using the clickable and timer class and uses a fun old picture of me as the button.

### How it works

A clickable picture is placed in the middle of the screen with text directing you to click it. After clicking it, chaos ensues and it uses a timer to count down and stop the random circle generation.
